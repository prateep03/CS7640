<h2><a name = "Overview">1. Overview</a></h2>
In this project we explore the application of image denoising using total variation. I have implemented the algorithm described
in the paper by A. Chambolle titled "An Algorithm for Total Variation Minimization and Applications". 

<P>

The following sections present details of the steps discussed above, and also provide information about implementation choices made. Section 2 describes the scale-space generation using iterative Gaussian blurring. Section 3 elaborates the use of Laplacian filtering to detect step-like features across scale-space. Section 4 goes into detail about local maxima detection of the Laplacian response across scale-space. The next two sections (5 & 6) provide results on the given test images and discuss some of the issues that arise from my implementation. The report concludes with a brief discussion of the implementation and goals for the rest of the semester.
